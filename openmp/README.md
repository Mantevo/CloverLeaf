# CloverLeaf_OpenMP

This is the OpenMP only version of CloverLeaf version 1.3. All MPI function calls have been removed.

## Release Notes

### Version 1.3

CloverLeaf 1.3 contains a number of optimisations over previous releases.
These include a number of loop fusion optimisations and the use of scalar variables over work arrays.
Overall this improves cache efficiency.

This version also contains some support for explicit tiling.
This is activated through the two input deck parameters:

* `tiles_per_chunk` To specify how many tiles per MPI ranks there are.
* `tiles_per_problem` To specify how many global tiles there are, this is rounded down to be an even number per MPI rank.

For compilation we now use the native Fortran and C compilers, not the MPI wrappers as before.
However specific compilation can be obtained with their use:

`make COMPILER=GNU MPI_COMPILER=gfortran C_MPI_COMPILER=gcc`

## Performance

Expected performance is give below.

If you do not see this performance, or you see variability, then is it recommended that you check MPI task placement and OpenMP thread affinities, because it is essential these are pinned and placed optimally to obtain best performance.

Note that performance can depend on compiler (brand and release), memory speed, system settings (e.g. turbo, huge pages), system load etc.
